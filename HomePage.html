	<h3> Introduction</h3>
    <p>
	I am a senior student at The University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems. As a Chinese who have spent three years in the United States, I have discovered and learned the countless cultural differences between two countries, which makes me open-minded and enthusiastic to uncertainty and novelty.
    </p>
	<p>
	Throughout the past three years, I have learned to use Microsoft applications, experienced multicultural collaborations in several courses, and learned several computer languages . More importantly I learned tons of knowledge about business. I plan to come back China after I finish my study, but I am more than happy to make friends with people who are also interested in business and technology.
